Create a comparison GIF from a before image and an after image.

## Install

Install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:
```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true npm run package
```
